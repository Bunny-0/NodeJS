2 ways of calling api : 
1)/myapi?value=100 (not really required to know about the oarameter 
, since ut takes the query in key value pair so , we can put many parameter as possible )
 ex:flipcart.com/result?search_query=backend & color=red & price=below 2000
2)/myapi/100-   (Easy to visit the url) ex: 1)github.com/shubham 2017
                                            2)youtube.com/shubhamgaurav
